#HW 1 Decision Tree

The way to run my program is to run car_main_driver.py or bank_main_driver.py depending on which dataset you want to look at. It will print out all iterations of depth and information metrics.

However these print outs aren't styled or formatted in any way so there is also a PDF is in this file titled HW1_Report.pdf that has the tables of each dataset with respect to depth, metrics etc.
