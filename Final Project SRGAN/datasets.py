"""
 	The basis of a GAN is pitting two neural networks against each other in a two player game in which the generator 
	is trained using real data and its goal is to produce data as close to the input as possible.  
	The discriminator is then fed a shuffled mix of output data from the generator and real data. 
	The discriminator tries to decipher which is real and which is artificial data.  
	This competition drives the loss for each system and ideally generates data that is 
	indistinguishable from the original input distribution.
