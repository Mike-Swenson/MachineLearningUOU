I've only included a few images that were used to train the models as there are too many to upload
All the parameters are hard coded. EG The adam values, number of epochs, learning rate etc

It can be run via
python srgan.py 

but without the a larger image set you'll get poor results and if running it with more data expect it to take awhile
